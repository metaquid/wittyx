It's a concept from quantum mechanics that explores the concept of superposition – where an object can exist in multiple states at once until it's observed or measured. In this experiment, a cat is placed in a box with a radioactive source and a vial of poison. If the radioactive source decays and releases enough alpha particles to break the vial, the poison will be released and the cat will die. The cat is not dead, nor alive, until the box is opened and observed. It's a fascinating concept that challenges our understanding of the universe!"
